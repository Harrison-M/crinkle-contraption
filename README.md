# Crinkle Contraption

A chess timer-like mechanic for my D&D 5e adventure, *I Unfortunately Lack the Legal Authority to Shut Down Headache Tower*. During a player's turn in the combat with Crinkle, the meter should fill while the player is not rolling dice.

When the meter fills, the player whose turn it is should roll d100 at the end of their turn.
- On 1-89, spawn a Mindwitness.
- On 90-99, spawn a Star Spawn Hulk.
- On 00, something weird happens (my version was setting-dependent).

There are 6 orbs in the combat room, each represented by a checkbox. When one of these orbs is broken or its cable is severed, the meter fill time is reduced by half. Bertram has a special version of the *Needle of Mending* that allows him to fix any of these that he is adjacent to instantly and as a legendary action.

Bertram Crinkle can cast a spell by spending 100 points for every level of the spell. This is what the 1-6 buttons are for.

## Calibration

The "turn time" is determined by how quickly your players can manipulate your tabletop/VTT. Create a challenge for them, such as "move your token your move speed toward a distant point" and press "Start Calibration" when they start, and the same button (now "Finish Calibration") when the last player completes it. If the meter is moving too fast or too slow during the game, you can use the Dif- and Dif+ to slow it down or speed it up, respectively.

## Adjustments

The -50 and +50 buttons will add or remove that much from the meter. This is good for, for instance, when a player makes a knowledge skill check near the contraption.
